# Money in UK politics

[The Westminster Accounts](https://news.sky.com/story/the-westminster-accounts-12786091), a recent collaboration between Sky News and Tortoise Media, examines the flow of money through UK politics. It does so by combining data from three key sources: 

1. [Register of Members’ Financial Interests](https://www.parliament.uk/mps-lords-and-offices/standards-and-financial-interests/parliamentary-commissioner-for-standards/registers-of-interests/register-of-members-financial-interests/), 
1. [Electoral Commission records of donations to parties](http://search.electoralcommission.org.uk/English/Search/Donations), and
1. [Register of All-Party Parliamentary Groups](https://www.parliament.uk/mps-lords-and-offices/standards-and-financial-interests/parliamentary-commissioner-for-standards/registers-of-interests/register-of-all-party-party-parliamentary-groups/). 

You can [search and explore the results](https://news.sky.com/story/westminster-accounts-search-for-your-mp-or-enter-your-full-postcode-12771627) through the collaboration’s interactive database. Simon Willison [has extracted a database](https://til.simonwillison.net/shot-scraper/scraping-flourish) and this is what we will be working with. If you want to read more about [the project’s methodology](https://www.tortoisemedia.com/2023/01/08/the-westminster-accounts-methodology/).


## Open a connection to the database

The database made available by Simon Willison is an `SQLite` database

```{r}
sky_westminster <- DBI::dbConnect(
  drv = RSQLite::SQLite(),
  dbname = here::here("data", "sky-westminster-files.db")
)
```

How many tables does the database have?

```{r}
DBI::dbListTables(sky_westminster)
```

## Which MP has received the most amount of money? 

You need to work with the `payments` and `members` tables and for now we just want the total among all years. To insert a new, blank chunk of code where you can write your beautiful code (and comments!), please use the following shortcut: `Ctrl + Alt + I` (Windows) or `cmd + option + I` (mac)
```{r}
#creating the object for members
members_db <- tbl(sky_westminster,"members")

members_db


#This is code that I derived with help from ChatGPT in order to extract the year from the date column in payments 
data <- dbGetQuery(sky_westminster, "SELECT * FROM payments")

data$year <- str_extract(data$date, "\\d{4}")

dbWriteTable(sky_westminster, "payments", data, overwrite = TRUE)


#creating the object for payments
payments_db <- tbl(sky_westminster,"payments") 

payments_db 


#joining payments and members
member_payments_db <- left_join(payments_db ,members_db %>% 
                                  
                                  rename(member_id = "id"), by = "member_id") %>% 
  
  select(name, party_id, member_id, entity, value, year) 

member_payments_db


#determining the value of donations by MP
max_mp_payment_dp <- member_payments_db %>% 
  
  group_by(name) %>% 
  
  summarise(total_donations = sum(value, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  
  arrange(desc(total_donations))

max_mp_payment_dp
```

As we can see in the table, Theresa May received the highest amount of donations at 2,809,765.42 GBP


## Any `entity` that accounts for more than 5% of all donations?

Is there any `entity` whose donations account for more than 5% of the total payments given to MPs over the 2020-2022 interval? Who are they and who did they give money to?

```{r}

#determining entities with 5% or higher
entity_donations <- member_payments_db %>% 
  
  group_by(entity) %>% 
  
  summarise(total_donations = sum(value)) %>% 
  
  mutate(overall_total = sum(total_donations)) %>% mutate(share = total_donations/overall_total) %>% 
  
  arrange(desc(share))

entity_donations


#retrieving the distinct MPs that Whithers donated to
whiters_donations <- member_payments_db %>% 
  
  filter(entity == "Withers LLP") %>% 
  
  group_by(name) %>% 
  
  summarise(total_donations = sum(value))

whiters_donations
```

Whiters LLP is the only entity that has more than 5% in donation share. They donated all 1,812,732 GBP to Geoffrey Cox

## Do `entity` donors give to a single party or not?

- How many distinct entities who paid money to MPS are there?
- How many (as a number and %) donated to MPs belonging to a single party only?

```{r}
#determining number of distinct entities
member_payments_db %>% 
  
  group_by(entity) %>% 
  
  summarise(sum = n()) %>% 
  
  ungroup() %>% 
  
  summarise(entities = n())


#creating the object for the partie database
parties_db <- tbl(sky_westminster,"parties")

parties_db


#joining parties with the already joined mebers and payments tables
party_payment_db <- left_join(member_payments_db,parties_db %>% 
                                
                                rename(party_id = "id",Party = "name"), by = "party_id")



#determining number of entities that have contributed to only one party
party_payment_db %>% 
  
  group_by(entity,Party) %>% 
  
  summarise(donations = sum(value)) %>% #simply summarising to be able to count the rows created from the grouping
  
  summarise(entity_party = n()) %>% #counting the number of contributions by entity
  
  filter(entity_party == 1) %>% #filtering for entities that have only contributed once (one party only)
  
  summarise(solo_contributors = n())



#creating a dataframe manually because after left joining the two previous summaries it returns 0 when mutating for a share
solo_entity_share <- tibble(total_entities = 2213,solo_contributors = 2036, share = 2036/2213 )        
                                                      
solo_entity_share

```

There are 2213 distinct entities. 2036 of these entities have donated to only one party, a share of 92%

## Which party has raised the greatest amount of money in each of the years 2020-2022? 

I would like you to write code that generates the following table. 

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "total_donations_table.png"), error = FALSE)
```

```{r}
#see in line 78 for extracting year from string in payments table

#determining party contribution by year
donations_by_party_year_db <- party_payment_db %>% 
  
  filter(year > 2019) %>% 
  
  group_by(year,Party) %>% 
  
  summarise(total_year_donations = sum(value)) %>% 
  
  group_by(year) %>% 
  
  mutate(sum = sum(total_year_donations),prop = total_year_donations/sum) %>% #calculate yearly proportion by party
  
  select(-sum) #drop temporary column needed for prop calculation

#removing scientific notation
options(scipen = 999)

donations_by_party_year_db
```


... and then, based on this data, plot the following graph. 

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "total_donations_graph.png"), error = FALSE)
```


```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="80%"}
#turning database into dataframe
party_donation_df <- donations_by_party_year_db %>% 
  
  collect() %>% 
  
  filter(total_year_donations > 100000) %>% #filtering out parties with less than 100,000 in donations
  
  #adding factor levels according to contribution levels for graph sorting
  mutate(Party = factor(Party, levels = c("Conservative","Labour","Liberal Democrats","Independent","Scottish National Party","Sinn Féin")))


#plotting column chart
ggplot(party_donation_df, aes(year,total_year_donations, fill = Party)) +
  
  geom_col(position = "dodge") +
  
  labs(title = "Conservatives have captured the majority of political donations", subtitle = "Donations to political parties, 2020-2022", x = NULL, y = NULL) +
  
  scale_y_continuous(labels = comma)
```

Finally, when you are done working with the databse, make sure you close the connection, or disconnect from the database.

```{r}
dbDisconnect(sky_westminster)
```


# Anonymised Covid patient data from the CDC

We will be using a dataset with [anonymous Covid-19 patient data that the CDC publishes every month](https://data.cdc.gov/Case-Surveillance/COVID-19-Case-Surveillance-Public-Use-Data-with-Ge/n8mc-b4w4). The file we will use was released on April 11, 2023, and has data on 98 million of patients, with 19 features. This file cannot be loaded in memory, but luckily we have the data in `parquet` format and we will use the `{arrow}` package.

## Obtain the data

The dataset `cdc-covid-geography` in in `parquet` format that {arrow}can handle. It is > 600Mb and too large to be hosted on Canvas or Github, so please download it from dropbox https://www.dropbox.com/sh/q1yk8mmnbbrzavl/AAAxzRtIhag9Nc_hODafGV2ka?dl=0 and save it in your `dsb` repo, under the `data` folder

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| message: false
#| warning: false


tic() # start timer
cdc_data <- open_dataset(here::here("data", "cdc-covid-geography"))
toc() # stop timer


glimpse(cdc_data)
```
Can you query the database and replicate the following plot?

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "covid-CFR-ICU.png"), error = FALSE)
```

The previous plot is an aggregate plot for all three years of data. What if we wanted to plot Case Fatality Ratio (CFR) over time? Write code that collects the relevant data from the database and plots the following


```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "cfr-icu-overtime.png"), error = FALSE)
```


For each patient, the dataframe also lists the patient's states and county [FIPS code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Information_Processing_Standard_state_code). The CDC also has information on the [NCHS Urban-Rural classification scheme for counties](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data_access/urban_rural.htm)
```{r}
urban_rural <- read_xlsx(here::here("data", "NCHSURCodes2013.xlsx")) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() 
```


Each county belongs in seix diffent categoreis, with categories 1-4 being urban areas and categories 5-6 being rural, according to the following criteria captured in `x2013_code`

Category name

1. Large central metro - 1 million or more population and contains the entire population of the largest principal city
2. large fringe metro - 1 million or more poulation, but does not qualify as 1
3. Medium metro - 250K - 1 million population
4. Small metropolitan population < 250K
5. Micropolitan 
6. Noncore

Can you query the database, extract the relevant information, and reproduce the following two graphs that look at the Case Fatality ratio (CFR) in different counties, according to their population?


```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "cfr-county-population.png"), error = FALSE)
```



```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "cfr-rural-urban.png"), error = FALSE)
```


# Money in US politics

In the United States, [*"only American citizens (and immigrants with green cards) can contribute to federal politics, but the American divisions of foreign companies can form political action committees (PACs) and collect contributions from their American employees."*](https://www.opensecrets.org/political-action-committees-pacs/foreign-connected-pacs)

We will scrape and work with data foreign connected PACs that donate to US political campaigns. The data for foreign connected PAC contributions in the 2022 election cycle can be found at https://www.opensecrets.org/political-action-committees-pacs/foreign-connected-pacs/2022. Then, we will use a similar approach to get data such contributions from previous years so that we can examine trends over time.

All data come from [OpenSecrets.org](https://www.opensecrets.org), a *"website tracking the influence of money on U.S. politics, and how that money affects policy and citizens' lives"*.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
#| label: allow-scraping-opensecrets
#| warning: false
#| message: false

library(robotstxt)
paths_allowed("https://www.opensecrets.org")

base_url <- "https://www.opensecrets.org/political-action-committees-pacs/foreign-connected-pacs/2022"

contributions_tables <- base_url %>%
  read_html() 

contributions <- contributions_tables %>% html_element("#DataTables_Table_0") %>% 
  html_table()

contributions



```

- First, make sure you can scrape the data for 2022. Use janitor::clean_names() to rename variables scraped using `snake_case` naming. 

- Clean the data: 

    -   Write a function that converts contribution amounts in `total`, `dems`, and `repubs` from character strings to numeric values.
    -   Separate the `country_of_origin_parent_company` into two such that country and parent company appear in different columns for country-level analysis.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# write a function to parse_currency
parse_currency <- function(x){
  x %>%
    
    # remove dollar signs
    str_remove("\\$") %>%
    
    # remove all occurrences of commas
    str_remove_all(",") %>%
    
    # convert to numeric
    as.numeric()
}

# clean country/parent co and contributions 
contributions <- contributions %>%
  separate(country_of_origin_parent_company, 
           into = c("country", "parent"), 
           sep = "/", 
           extra = "merge") %>%
  mutate(
    total = parse_currency(total),
    dems = parse_currency(dems),
    repubs = parse_currency(repubs)
  )
```




-   Write a function called `scrape_pac()` that scrapes information from the Open Secrets webpage for foreign-connected PAC contributions in a given year. This function should

    -   have one input: the URL of the webpage and should return a data frame.
    -   add a new column to the data frame for `year`. We will want this information when we ultimately have data from all years, so this is a good time to keep track of it. Our function doesn't take a year argument, but the year is embedded in the URL, so we can extract it out of there, and add it as a new column. Use the `str_sub()` function to extract the last 4 characters from the URL. You will probably want to look at the help for this function to figure out how to specify "last 4 characters".

-   Define the URLs for 2022, 2020, and 2000 contributions. Then, test your function using these URLs as inputs. Does the function seem to do what you expected it to do?

-   Construct a vector called `urls` that contains the URLs for each webpage that contains information on foreign-connected PAC contributions for a given year.

-   Map the `scrape_pac()` function over `urls` in a way that will result in a data frame called `contributions_all`.

-   Write the data frame to a csv file called `contributions-all.csv` in the `data` folder.


# Scraping consulting jobs

The website [https://www.consultancy.uk/jobs/](https://www.consultancy.uk/jobs) lists job openings for consulting jobs.

```{r}
#| label: consulting_jobs_url
#| eval: false

library(robotstxt)
paths_allowed("https://www.consultancy.uk") #is it ok to scrape?

base_url <- "https://www.consultancy.uk/jobs/page/"

```

Can you get all pages of ads, and not just the first one, `https://www.consultancy.uk/jobs/page/1` into a dataframe?


-   Construct a vector called `pages` that contains the numbers for each page available


-   Map the `scrape_jobs()` function over `pages` in a way that will result in a data frame called `all_consulting_jobs`.

-   Write the data frame to a csv file called `all_consulting_jobs.csv` in the `data` folder.

```{r}
#creating a vector with available page numbers, in this case there are 8 pages on the website
page_vec <- 1:8


#writing the scape jobs function with parameter page as input for page numbers, a placeholder for the vector
scape_jobs <- function(page) {
  url <- str_c(base_url,page)
  listing_html <- url %>% read_html()
  jobs_df <- listing_html %>% html_element("#dataTable") %>% html_table()
}


#running the created function with the vector as input and creating the combined result as a dataframe
all_consulting_jobs <- map_df(page_vec,scape_jobs)

all_consulting_jobs


#writing as a csv file

# Create a shiny app 

We have already worked with the data on electricity production and usage, GDP/capita and CO2/capita since 1990.
You have to create a simple Shiny app, where a user chooses a country from a drop down list and a time interval between 1990 and 2020 and shiny outputs the following

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "electricity-shiny.png"), error = FALSE)
```

You can use chatGPT to get the basic layout of Shiny app, but you need to adjust the code it gives you. Ask chatGPT to create the Shiny app using the `gapminder` data and make up similar requests for the inputs/outpus you are thinking of deploying.

Code is well-documented (both self-documented and with additional comments as necessary). Used tidyverse, instead of base R. Graphs and tables are properly labelled. Analysis is clear and easy to follow, either because graphs are labeled clearly or you've written additional text to describe how you interpret the output. Multiple Github commits. Work is exceptional. I will not assign these often.

8/13: Problem set is 60--80% complete and most answers are correct. This is the expected level of performance. Solid effort. Hits all the elements. No clear mistakes. Easy to follow (both the code and the output). A few Github commits.

5/13: Problem set is less than 60% complete and/or most answers are incorrect. This indicates that you need to improve next time. I will hopefully not assign these often. Displays minimal effort. Doesn't complete all components. Code is poorly written and not documented. Uses the same type of plot for each graph, or doesn't use plots appropriate for the variables being analyzed. No Github commits.
